## Summary
This PR completes the implementation of the **Exerciseâ€¯2 â€“ Dungeon Crawler** game according to the assignment requirements.  
The project is a turnâ€‘based CLI game built in Java, featuring a randomly generated dungeon, multiple enemy types, items, and a player inventory system.

## Key Features

### ðŸ§© OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Private/protected fields with getters/setters; inventory managed via dedicated methods.
- **Inheritance**: `Player` and `Enemy` extend `Character`; multiple enemy subclasses (`Goblin`, `Ghost`, `Troll`, `Dragon`).
- **Polymorphism**: Abstract methods (`getAttackDamage`, `takeTurn`) overridden in subclasses; `Combat` works with `Character` references.

### ðŸ—º Dungeon Map
- `DungeonGrid` with walls, floor tiles, and printed map view.

### ðŸŽ² Random Generation
- `RandomGeneration` ensures valid placement of enemies and items.

### âš” Game Mechanics
- Movement with collision detection.
- Combat system with both interactive (`start`) and testâ€‘friendly (`doAttack`) modes.
- Inventory management and item usage (`HealthPotion`).

### ðŸ§ª Testing (JUnit 5)
1. **Movement logic** â€“ verifies player cannot move through walls.  
2. **Combat calculations** â€“ verifies enemy HP decreases after attack.  
3. **Item effects** â€“ verifies potion use increases player HP.  
4. **Map generation** â€“ verifies random positions are inâ€‘bounds and not walls.
